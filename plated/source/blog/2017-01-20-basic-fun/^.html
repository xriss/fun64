A cut down and basic fun example, we do not make many assumptions so 
you are free to configure and setup your code to your own tastes.

There are only two parts that you must provide for fun to work. The 
first is a table describing the virtual hardware component setup, eg 
the resolution of screen and tilemaps and sprite layers to display.

	hardware={
		{
			component="screen",
			size={424,240}, -- lowrez with a 1920x1080 aspect
			scale=3, -- draw in a window at 3 times scale
			fps=60, -- 60 fps please
		},
		...
	}

This requests the virtual hardware that will be setup before main is 
called.

The second is a main function which will be called as a yield-able 
co-routine with a table that should be treated as an incoming message. 
Use the basic skeleton below to receive need.setup/update/draw 
requests. As you can see it is possible to have multiple needs at once 
and this call structure allows for a setup, repeat update/draw then cleanup 
flow of code within this co-routine.

	function main(need)
		if not need.setup then need=coroutine.yield() end -- wait for setup request
		
		-- perform setup
		
		local done=false while not done do
			need=coroutine.yield()
			
			if need.update then

				-- perform update

			end

			if need.draw then

				-- perform draw

			end			
			
			if need.clean then done=true end -- cleanup requested
		end

		-- perform cleanup

	end
