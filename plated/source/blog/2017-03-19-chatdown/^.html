Chatdown is  a markdown like text format for describing chat trees, the 
idea is to have all the logic somewhere else and just use this for 
describing the relationship and hierarchy of the text.

The bad news is this means you have to label each part of the chat with 
reasonable ids so the code can find it. Naming things is hard and has
to be done.

Mostly the file is interpreted as paragraphs similar to markdowns 
paragraphs separated by empty lines, between these paragraphs lines 
beginning with one of the special characters #<>= switch the mode, and 
assign where the next set of paragraphs will be stored.

Following immediately on from these special characters with no white 
space in between are the id labels, these are used to name each set of 
paragraphs and allow references between them. This is the most complex 
part of the chatdown format.

A chat is started by beginning a line with a # this can be thought of 
as the talky part of an NPCs brain and a chatdown file contains 
multiple chats. These chats can reference each other, for example one 
NPC can check what you have told another NPC.

The first paragraph of a #chat is the display name of the NPC, the rest 
of the paragraphs are a longer description. More data can also be 
associated with the NPC here but I will go into that another time.

Responses are started with a < and they belong to the current chat, 
these are the things that an NPC says, for instance, <welcome is the 
first thing an NPC says when you talk to them.

Decisions are your choices that can be made after an NPC talks, started 
with a > these are stored in the current response and are primarily 
links to another response.

With decisions the first paragraph is displayed and the remaining 
paragraphs can be used as the spoken out loud dialogue. Some styles of 
dialogue writing use this form, others only need the first paragraph.

Proxies are variables associated with this chat, they are assigned by 
lines beginning with an = and all paragraphs following are given to 
this proxy. Proxies way be set inside any of the other states and the 
change will happen as you progress through the chat. This allows us to 
track decisions by changing a proxy inside the decision.

Proxies may be expanded inside paragraphs or even option names by using 
squiggly brackets like so {proxyname}, more complicated expansions will 
be added later if needed.

This is just an overview and its best we explain with some code, so 
take a look at the following chatdown example which you will find 
embedded at the top of this fun64 file. The code to parse and display 
this format is included, probably best you do not look too closely at 
that bit :)

Since chatdown took some time to formalise, it is also going to take 
more than one short post to explain, expect a follow up with a more 
complex example.
