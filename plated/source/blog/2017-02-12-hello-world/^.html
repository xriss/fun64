Apparently if your hello world example is longer than a couple of lines 
then you are open to ridicule.

I suspect people who say this are blissfully unaware exactly what _main 
gets up to before your code runs and lets not even think about C++.

Still it helps to remove as much gubbins as possible so the code that's 
running becomes obvious. Fun64 is built around the idea that you should 
define the hardware before the program runs so lets hide all that away 
inside a builtin function that will set you up a basic looking screen 
to work with.

Introducing the configurator, this function will provide various setups 
depending on the mode requested and also provide a main function that 
will allow you to provide a single update function rather than dealing 
with more complexities. A single update function is less optimal but a 
perfectly reasonable way to write short bits of test code.

So far the only mode we have is "fun64" which will get you a 60fps 
320x240 screen with three layers and the Swanky32 palette. The three 
layers gives us a copper background, a tile+sprite foreground and 
finally a text overlay on the very top. For graphical memory we have a 
64x64 area of 8x8 tiles (4096 in total) and we auto upload the 4x8 
fun64 font to the very first line for use by the text layer.

NB: If you clobber this top line all your text will go funny, just like 
on real hardware.

The main point of the layers is so we can have drop shadows between 
them, the text layer on top gives us some very cheap 80s looking text 
menus when used with solid blocks of background color.
