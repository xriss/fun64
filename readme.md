Welcome to fun64 the super simple super lowrez single file game engine 
powered by gamecake.

Try the live html version of the example projects here, this site can be fund in the plated/source folder.

Note that we can not use github pages anymore as it does not send headers now required by wasm.

Be sure to use git-pull to get latest gamecake binaries into the exe directory

	git clone https://github.com/xriss/fun64.git
	cd fun64
	./git-pull

The same also needs to be done when you pull updates, so remember to 
use the git pull script provided or your bin dir might get out of sync.

	./git-pull
