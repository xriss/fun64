FunFont64
=========

FunFont64 is primarily a 4x8 fixed width pixel font designed for use in 
Fun64 as the smallest fixed font you can get away with.

This font has been upscaled by hand to 8x16 where it is a readable 
console font on 1080p displays and we have enough pixels to support 
regular and italic/oblique versions.

We have all the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_8859-15 glyphs 
Which is mostly the first 256 unicode glyphs and mostly covers Western 
European text, mostly.

FunFont64 is designed to be used with a character based fragment 
shader, take a look at the Fun64 source for an example of how that 
works.

Please feel free to use and modify and republish in anyway you like, the 
included MIT license just seems the least terrible option.
