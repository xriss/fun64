Welcome to fun64 the super simple super lowrez single file game engine 
powered by gamecake.

Try the live html version of the example projects here

https://xriss.github.io/fun64

Be sure to clone with submodules as the engine binaries live in a 
permanently orphaned branch.

	git clone --recursive https://github.com/xriss/fun64.git

The same also needs to be done when you pull updates, so remember to 
use the git pull script provided or your bin dir might get out of sync.

	./git-pull
